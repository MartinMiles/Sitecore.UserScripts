# Sitecore.UserScripts

A collection of user script that work with Sitecore, helping you to extend default shell functionality in order to increase productivity. A user script is programming that modifies the appearance or behavior of an application. A user script for a Web site, for example, can customize the way that content will display in the host browser, navigation and DOM manipulation is also a feature. 

## What's inside?

There are currently 3 script which you can combine (all or partly), or just use individually:
* [Autologin](https://github.com/MartinMiles/Sitecore.UserScripts/blob/master/Sitecore.UserScripts.Autologin.user.js) - automatically logs into Sitecore, especially helpful on session timeouts
* [LaunchPad_Redirects_to_Desktop](https://github.com/MartinMiles/Sitecore.UserScripts/blob/master/Sitecore.UserScripts.LaunchPad_Redirects_to_Desktop.user.js) - redirects you from Launchpad to shell (Sitecore Desktop)
* [Preload_Content_Editors_For_SXA](https://github.com/MartinMiles/Sitecore.UserScripts/blob/master/Sitecore.UserScripts.Preload_Content_Editors_For_SXA.user.js) - this script loads 6 Content Editor windows in Sitecore and preloads each with specified items, configurable.


## Making it work

Despite Google Chrome supports these scripts out of the box and treats them as regular extensions, I'd recomment installing TamperMonkey extension for Chrome or GreaseMonkey for Firefox:
* [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) - TamperMonkey for Chrome
* [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) - GreaseMonkey for Firefox

Once installed, put the scripts into an extension and enjoy ;)
