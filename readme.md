# Sitecore.UserScripts

A collection of user script that work with Sitecore, helping you to extend default shell functionality in order to increase productivity. A user script is programming that modifies the appearance or behavior of an application. A user script for a Web site, for example, can customize the way that content will display in the host browser, navigation and DOM manipulation is also a feature. 

## Making it work

Despite Google Chrome supports these scripts out of the box and treats them as regular extensions, I'd recomment installing TamperMonkey extension for Chrome or GreaseMonkey for Firefox:
* [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) - TamperMonkey for Chrome
* [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) - GreaseMonkey for Firefox

Once installed, put the scripts into an extension and enjoy ;)
